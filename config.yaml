# Knowledge Harness Configuration
# ================================
# Tune these parameters based on your usage patterns.

# Database
database:
  path: "./knowledge.db"
  
# Chunking
chunking:
  # For paragraph-based chunking
  min_chunk_size: 200      # Minimum characters per chunk
  max_chunk_size: 1500     # Maximum characters per chunk
  
  # Keep short documents whole
  whole_doc_threshold: 1500

# Retrieval weights (should roughly sum to 1.0)
retrieval:
  weights:
    keyword: 0.20
    semantic: 0.30
    concept: 0.20
    usage: 0.20
    recency: 0.10
  
  # How fast does recency decay? (half-life in days)
  recency_halflife_days: 30
  
  # Usage-based adjustments
  usage_boost_threshold: 0.70    # Boost chunks with success rate above this
  usage_penalty_threshold: 0.30  # Penalize chunks below this
  
  # Default result limits
  default_limit: 10

# Consolidation
consolidation:
  # After how many days of no access should content be flagged as stale?
  stale_threshold_days: 90
  
  # Minimum usage traces before adjusting scores
  min_traces_for_adjustment: 3

# Concept extraction (guidance for LLM)
concepts:
  # Maximum concepts to extract per document
